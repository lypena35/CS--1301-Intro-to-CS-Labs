  /*
 * PLTL Session: Methods
 * Given an algorithm you are required to look through the corresponding code and fix the errors on the syntax.
 * Also, make sure that the logic is correct and the code works the way it is required.
 * The algorithm is as follows:
 *  a. Ask the user to enter a password.
 *  b. Ask the user to re-enter the password.
 *  c. If the password do not match print "Sorry the value entered is incorrect - try again".
 *  d. If the password match then print "Thank you. You have entered the correct password". 
 *  e. The system will keep track of the total number of tries and print them at the end.
